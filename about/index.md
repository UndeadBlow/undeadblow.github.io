![It's me](/images/ava.jpg)

Hello, my name is Maksim Kuprashevich, and mainly I am IT specialist and software developer.

I was born in beautiful city Saint-Petersburg (at the time it was called Leningrad), in Russia (USSR), in 1991.
This is city of wind and water :)

I graduated from the Russian Saint-Petersburg State Institute of Technology in 2014 year with bachelor degree, specialty "Computer Science and Engineering" with 4.6 of 5 average ball.

I love programming. I think it is an art, the triumph of human logical thought. It's like you are a little god, when you can create everything you desire.
Mainly I work with C++ (and Qt <3) or Python but I don't care about instruments I use. I care about task. So I can use many instruments, depends on what I wish to get. As well as every good programmer do, I think.
Also, I'm enjoyed bioinformatics with that awesome guys:

That's amazing science.

For now, I am Lead AI Engineer at [Computer Vision Systems](http://comvisionsys.ru/) and [[Lanit-Tercom]](http://lanit-tercom.ru/). 
As leader, I am manage the team of 9 developers and data scientists. I make technical decisions, lead projects from specification to deployment, manage the entire life cycle of data collection and labeling, teach new employees. 
As specialist, I'm work with various computer vision tasks, research new and existing methods, work with many deep learning techniques, design networks, develop software solutions.

What else about me? I love photo. If you are interested, some my photos are here on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131639781@N06/albums/72157657038419862).
Music is good enough to spend much time too. I love rock, metal, alternative but my tastes not tied to something one too strong also.
Movies and TV series? Of course! I have seen, maybe, about all popular TV series and most of good films for the last decade.

And I love to learn. That's, maybe, my meaning of life.
Programming, Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Cybernetics, Electronics, Computer Science and Algorithms, Biology, Medicine, Genetics, Bioinformatics, Chemistry, Zoology, Physics... how much I wish to know perfectly and how short our life is!
Thanks to MOOCs we can do something with that sad fact.
