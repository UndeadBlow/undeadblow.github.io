Very big, long-term project on which I'm working in Navmii company.
Main purpose of the project is to create ADAS (Advanced Driver Assisting System) for any mobile phone.
So that user will be able to just download it from Google Play and have program that will warning him about front collisions,
signs, lane departures and etc.

Many utils were written during project, most interesting of them you can see on screenshots below, so that project is not only about
end product (Dashcam), it is about many interesting ideas, tools, about research.

During project I worked with endless count of tools and technologies: most of shallow ML methods, Deep Learning, Convolutional Networks, Caffe, Torch, OpenCV and Tensorflow frameworks, Image Processing methods, etc, etc. I even got experience of Android programming.

On project working only 2 specialists, I and [Anton Varfolomeev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dizvara/). All data is used in project we collected ourselves.

Here, on screenshots, you can find:
<ul>
<li>Video Detector - tool that plays videos and passes frames to networks. It can work with Caffe, Torch, Tensor models. Created for testing and debugging models, also for collecting new data. Here on screenshots presented distance detection model.</li>
<li>Annotation Tool - tool for annotation frames with many classes. For SSD networks.</li>
<li>General Dashcam - end product.</li>
</ul>

On video you can see debug application for cars distance prediction and advertising video of out client product - Cocar.
It works with special version of Dashcam inside.

Project for Biocad company. For security purposes it is without much of details.

This software package allows Biocad-card users to safe run and authorize in various programs, list of which can be extended by admin with
plugins (using Dynamic Link Libraries). Also it allows to login in Windows with user card.
Project performed on Qt, but uses very low-level Windows tools, so it is not cross-platform.
Many changes was solved durig work, because app must be very safe and flexible, and main challenge was to secure card-software interaction, to prevent grabbing information with Low-Level Hooks in Windows.

My own project that I sometimes developing in my spare time. This is the Google Chrome extension for translation english words and sentences on russian.
I started that project because current translators like LinguaLeo wants money for adding many words in your dictionary per day and I don't like it.

I have never worked before with Javascript, HTML and CSS before that project, but learned a few things in the process.
For translation this extension uses three servises (at now) with open API: <a href="https://translate.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Translate</a>, <a href="https://mymemory.translated.net/">MyMemory</a> and <a href="http://www.frengly.com/">Frengly</a>.
In the future, I'm planning to modify this exstension to save words to <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a> format files to use it with this awesome program.
